### TODO:

- I18n.
- Teach bots play 10x10x5 with better heuristic. Currently "expert" can be caught in trap as they don't
look too far behind immediate loss. Potential loss is different when W < M (or N).
- Look into non-square games, like 10x6x4.
- Multi-player support (websockets).
- More tests.
